# Authors

The project was initiated by [Sergei Bogolepov](https://github.com/Sergei-vb) as a part of [MMB](https://github.com/tolstoyevsky/mmb). A little later, [Evgeny Golyshev](https://github.com/eugulixes) extracted the code and placed it in a stand-alone project. Currently rocketchat-tests-based-on-splinter is maintained by Sergei Bogolepov and Evgeny Golyshev.
